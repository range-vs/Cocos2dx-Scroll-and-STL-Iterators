### Test project Cocos 2dx and C++ STL conteiner (vector)

This repository contains a buildable Cocos 2dx project for:
+ Linux(Code Blocks & Makefile (generate from CMake));
+ Windows (Visual Studo & MSBuild(generate from CMake));
+ Android Studio (CMake).

Composed of:
+ STL - compatible vector;
+ Full set of iterators (forward, back, const etc);
+ Input and output iterators;
+ BackInsterter iterator.

As a test, a ScrollView from Cocos 2dx is created and the output is directed to the console and to the ScrollView using the new iterators
